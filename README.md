# Auto learn

This is a simple script to help get faster in learning. When possible, it will help you to click on right button.

Note: if you do not know what is it about, please do not execute it.

If you know why you're here, simply:
1. focus the learning window (it's the big pop-up)
2. open the console (F12)
3. copy-paste the following code into console
4. you're done!

```js
fetch('https://github.com/baxyz/auto-learn/blob/main/auto-learn.js').then(response => response.text()).then(eval);
```

This piece of code will load the file aside named `auto-learn.js`.
